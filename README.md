# Portfolio-2023

This is a project to show my projects ðŸš€

## Build Setup

The usual process for Nuxt.js based apps/websites:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# generate static project BEFORE PULL REQUEST
npm run generate

# build ssr projects BEFORE PULL REQUEST
npm run build

# try launching project BEFORE PULL REQUEST
npm run preview
```
